## 📌 Project Overview
This project was developed as part of my QA learning journey, focusing on automated testing for a login feature using BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) with Behave, Selenium WebDriver, and Allure Reports.

The goal is to practice end-to-end functional testing with realistic scenarios, validating both positive and negative flows, and generating professional reports for better traceability of results.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Automate login scenarios following the BDD approach.
- Validate successful and unsuccessful authentication flows.
- Execute tests in headless mode for CI/CD pipelines.
- Generate HTML reports using Allure.
- Run tests automatically via GitHub Actions.

## 🔧 Technologies and Tools
- Python
- Behave (BDD framework using Gherkin syntax)
- Selenium WebDriver
- Allure Reports
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/celiapaivab/qa-bdd-selenium-login
cd qa-bdd-selenium-login
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```

3. Install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run Tests (Simple Output)
```bash
behave
```

5. Run the tests locally with Allure:
```bash
behave -f allure_behave.formatter:AllureFormatter -o reports/allure-results
allure serve reports/allure-results
```

## 🧾 Results
- BDD scenarios implemented for positive and negative login flows.
- Headless execution configured for CI pipelines.
- Allure reports generated and published as GitHub Actions artifacts.
- Test suite running successfully in local and remote environments.

## 📚 What I Learned
- Applied BDD with Behave for readable test scenarios.
- Used Selenium WebDriver for browser automation.
- Generated and published Allure Reports.
- Integrated automated tests into a GitHub Actions pipeline.

## 💡 Future Improvements
- Add more scenarios to cover additional edge cases.
- Implement parameterized steps for improved reusability.
- Integrate cross-browser testing.
- Schedule nightly automated test runs.
